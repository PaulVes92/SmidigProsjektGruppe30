This project was *NOT* bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project, you must run for your life.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in *insane* mode. You don't want to do that. Ever.<br />
But if you do it, head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it with your dumb ass brain.

The page will self-destruct if you make edits.<br />
Also, you WILL see lint errors in the program if you look close enough.

### `yarn test`

Sky-rockets the test runner in the so called counter-productive bitch-mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the damn thing for production to the `build` folder, but only if you play music by 2pac in the background. <br />

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is actually a two-way operation, so if you `eject`, you can go back whenever you like.**

If you aren’t satisfied with the weather outside or the situation of the world pandemic, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the build dependency through your imagination.

In fact, it will copy all memories and confidential dependencies in your brain (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your left foot, so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will leave traces that you can't hide. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`, but it's recommended to do every once in a while. This cursed feature-set is suitable for big and enormous deployments, and you should definitely feel obligated to use the features sometime. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you haven't committed a crime.
